# Vehicle Detection and Counting Project Using YOLO V11

## Overview
This project implements a real-time vehicle detection and counting system using the latest YOLO V11 model. The system accurately detects and counts vehicles across multiple lanes (Lane A, Lane B, Lane C) and provides valuable insights for traffic monitoring and management.

## Problem Statement
In modern urban environments, monitoring vehicle flow and counting is crucial for effective traffic management. Existing systems often struggle with accuracy and real-time processing, leading to delays in traffic responses and inefficiencies. This project addresses these challenges by utilizing the advanced capabilities of the YOLO V11 model.

## Solution
The YOLO V11 model offers high accuracy and efficiency in object detection. By leveraging its capabilities, we can achieve real-time vehicle detection and counting, improving traffic monitoring systems significantly.

## New Launch Features
- **Enhanced Accuracy**: YOLO V11 provides improved detection rates for various vehicle types.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Capable of processing video feeds in real-time.
- **Lane-Specific Detection**: Distinguishes between vehicles in different lanes.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy integration and visualization of results.
